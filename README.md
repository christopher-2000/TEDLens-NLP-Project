# TEDLens : Elevating TED Talk Recovery
## Abstract
TED Talks, known for their wealth of knowledge and diverse ideas, continue to serve as an invaluable resource for students and researchers across various domains. Whether used as a foundational resource or for the in-depth exploration of technical concepts, these talks remain a wellspring of inspiration and wisdom. Our aim is to harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract valuable insights from the transcripts and descriptions of these talks.
